Your machine does not have unlimited strength crypto installed, so some Magritte functionality won't work.

To resolve this:
1. Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html
2. Accept and download jce_policy-8.zip
3. Unzip
4. Copy `local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar` into your `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security` (replacing the existing files).
5. Be sure to stop the gradle daemon after replacing the jars otherwise it won't pick up the changes.
   You can do this with `./gradlew --stop`. You should then be able to run the command you were trying to run before.
6. Should (5) fail, you can try running `jps` to get a list of running Java processes. e.g.
     19808 Jps
     19537 GradleWrapperMain
     15861 GradleDaemon
   Running `kill -9 <gradle daemon process id>` or in this example `kill -9 15861` will forcibly kill the daemon.

NOTE:
If you *really* know what you are doing you can disable this check by setting the system property `disable.crypto.check` to true.
e.g. ./gradlew idea -D disable.crypto.check=true"
